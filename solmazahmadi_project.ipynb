The RDD is motivated by the idea that the students who score just above the threshold for being put on academic probation provide a good counterfactual to the 'treatment group' that scores just below the threshold. In line with the performance standard model that serves as the theoretical framework for the paper, Lindo et al. (2010) find that being placed on probation induces students to drop out but increases the grades of the students who remain in school.
